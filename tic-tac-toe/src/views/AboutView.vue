    <h1>About Tic Tac Toe</h1>
    <pre><q>Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.</q> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe" target="_blank">(wikipedia)</a></pre>

    <h1> Why Am I Doing This? </h1>
    <h5>I set out to write versions of tic tac toe in every language I know,</h5>
    <h5>just as a fun experiment.</h5>
    <h5>This is my attempt at doing it with VueJS.</h5>
